                                        I've been involved in technology for a long time, working in creative applications like
                                        Adobe Creative Suite (now 'Creative Cloud', whatever) and 3DS Max to generate print and web media as
                                        a graphic designer.
                                        The creation of static content takes time and skill like anything else, but is an intuitive process
                                        utilizing the loose principles of design.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        My first exposure to computer science, or programming, was straight BASIC on an old Windows 95 machine.
                                        I was able to create a few programs or scripts that could echo user input and do basic math. It was all text based.
                                        What I really wanted was to generate visual content, something interactive and more engaging than terminal output.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        The development of interactive graphic content multiplies the problems of visual design by the technical difficulties
                                        of programming. The result is of course well worth the trouble. It is the way we interact with technology and share
                                        information. It is the way that we communicate with eachother. It's how we work to solve problems.
                                        For me, web development provides a means of not only exploring this intersection between design and development, but
                                        an opportunity to create engaging content and practical solutions.
